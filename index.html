        <p>Education is indeed a basic need like food, clothing and shelter. Never miss an opportunity to learn and grow for want of finance. Carve out a bright future with our Special Vidya Loan</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Debit/Credit Cards: Federal Bank offers special debit/credit cards for students with features such as cashback, discounts, and other offers.</li>
            <li>Loan Amount: The loan amount varies depending on the course and the institute you have applied for. Typically, banks offer loans up to Rs. 10 lakhs for studies in India and up to Rs. 20 lakhs for studies abroad. However, some banks may offer higher amounts based on the applicant's profile and the course selected.</li>
        
        <li>
            Interest Rate: The interest rate on student loans is usually lower than the regular personal loans. It ranges between 8.50% to 12.50%, depending on the bank, the loan amount, and the repayment period.
        </li>
        
        <li>Repayment: The repayment period for student loans is usually between 5 to 7 years, but it may vary depending on the bank's policies. Some banks may also offer a moratorium period where you don't have to pay the loan EMI until the course completion or a few months after getting a job.</li>
        <li>Interest Calculation: The interest on a student loan is calculated based on the outstanding loan amount and the interest rate. The interest is typically calculated on a daily or monthly reducing balance, which means that the interest is charged only on the outstanding principal amount and not on the entire loan amount.

                <p>Here are the general eligibility criteria for a student loan in India:

                
                    
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You should be an Indian citizen to apply for a student loan..
                    </li>
        <li> You should be above 18 years of age to be eligible for a student loan. In some cases, banks may require the borrower to be between 18 to 35 years of age.</li>
        <li> You should have secured admission to a recognized course in India or abroad. The course could be a graduate, post-graduate, diploma, or professional course.</li>
        <li> The institute and course should be recognized by a competent authority. Banks may have their own list of approved institutes and courses, so it's important to check with the bank before applying.</li>
        <li> Most banks require a co-borrower for a student loan, who could be your parent, guardian, or spouse. The co-borrower should have a regular source of income and a good credit history.</li>
        <li> Banks may require collateral or security to approve a student loan, especially for high loan amounts. The collateral could be a house, property, fixed deposit, or any other asset of equivalent value. Some banks may also offer unsecured loans for certain courses or based on the borrower's profile.</li>
        <li>The borrower and the co-borrower should have a good credit score, which indicates their creditworthiness and repayment capacity. A good credit score increases the chances of loan approval and may also result in a lower interest rate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can visit Canara Bank’s website or any of their branches to learn more about these schemes and their eligibility criteria</p>
